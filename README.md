# Explanation:
# HTML Code (index.html):
- 'meta' Tags: These meta tags define the character encoding and the viewport settings for responsive design.
- 'link' Tags: These 'link' tags include external CSS stylesheets and fonts. The first link includes Google Fonts, the second includes Font Awesome for icons, and 
   the third links to an external CSS file called "styles.css."
- 'main' Element: This is the main content container of your webpage.
- 'section' Elements: These represent different sections of your content, such as the "heading" and "text" sections.
- Various HTML elements like 'header;, 'h1', 'p', 'a', 'img', 'blockquote', and 'ul' are used to structure and format our content.
- Classes (e.g., class="heading", class="first-paragraph") are used to group and style elements in CSS.
# CSS Code (styles.css):
- Universal Selector *: This selector resets margins and paddings to zero and sets the box-sizing property to border-box for all elements, ensuring consistent spacing and sizing.
- html: Sets the base font size to 62.5% (10px by default), making it easier to use relative units like rem for font sizes.

  widths.
